"""
BLE provisioning (Blynk.Inject protocol) - runs at startup when there's no
stored auth token yet, instead of the normal MQTT-based operation. Also
re-entered in place, without exiting the process, by BlynkAgent's
connectivity watchdog after sustained connectivity loss on an
already-configured device (see the `reprovisioning` flag below).

Implements info/ifs/scan/set/connect/reset/reboot. Real WiFi devices are
reported (and can actually be scanned/connected) via NetworkManager's
D-Bus API - confirmed against real hardware, since every prior network
interface reported here was a fake "eth" purely to skip the app's WiFi
picker (the doc suggests ifs/scan can be skipped for a device with
connectivity some other way, but the real app sends "ifs" unconditionally
and won't proceed past reading device details without a response to it -
confirmed via btmon against real hardware).

Cellular ("cell") is also implemented - NetworkManager activates the
connection (same D-Bus pattern as WiFi, a "gsm" connection type instead of
"802-11-wireless"), while modem/SIM identity and lock state (IMEI/IMSI/
ICCID/PIN-required) come from ModemManager, a separate D-Bus service NM
doesn't expose that information through itself. Confirmed against real
hardware on two independent modems (a SIMCOM SIM7600G on a CompuLab
IOT-GATE-iMX8, and a SIMCOM SIM7070 on a Raspberry Pi 5) - real SIM
detection, PIN-lock handling, and a genuine end-to-end cellular data
connection to Blynk Cloud all confirmed working. Note: automatic PLMN
(network operator) selection can get stuck attempting to register on a
network the SIM isn't actually authorized for, even when other visible
networks would work fine - confirmed on real hardware with a roaming
IoT SIM. This code doesn't work around that (relies on ModemManager/
NetworkManager's default automatic selection); if it comes up again in
the field, manually selecting a different operator via ModemManager
resolves it.

Note: bluez-peripheral's PyPI release (0.1.7) predates the API shown on
its own docs site (which tracks an unreleased rewrite on GitHub master) -
imports and a few call signatures below are deliberately the older,
actually-installed shapes, confirmed against the installed package itself
rather than the docs site.
